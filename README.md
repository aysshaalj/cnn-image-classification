# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning.

## Model
- Multi-layer CNN architecture
- Convolution, pooling, and dense layers
- Trained using supervised learning

## What I Implemented
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN model design
- Training and evaluation
- Accuracy visualization

## Tools
Python, TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
Open `CNNS.ipynb` in Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
